# weatherDashboard

My goal is to make a weather dashboard that will contain a search prompt to populate city, and show a 5 day forecast for that city along with a readout of the weather today for the city with info for temp, humidity, UV index and wind.

## Currently struggling to get the API key to work properly. Work in progress.
